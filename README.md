Task 7 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

# 🛡️ Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
To learn how to review, identify, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions to ensure safe browsing and better performance.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Browser: Microsoft Edge

## 🔍 Task Summary
I accessed the extension settings in Microsoft Edge to review installed extensions. After inspection:
   - ✅ **No extensions were installed** in the browser.
   - 📸 Screenshot was taken as proof (if applicable).

## 📌 What to Check in Browser Extensions (Guidelines)
   If any extensions were present, I would review them based on the following:

### ⚠️ Risk Indicators:
- Unknown or suspicious extension names
- Low ratings or negative reviews
- Excessive permissions, such as:
  - “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit”
  - “Access your clipboard”
  - “Read your browsing history”

## 🗑️ Actions to Take for Suspicious Extensions
If any of the above risks were identified, the steps would be:
   1. Click “Remove” or “Disable” the extension.
   2. Restart the browser to apply changes.

## ✅ Benefits of Completing the Task
- Improved browser security and performance
- Reduced risk of data theft or malware
- Gained practical awareness of browser extension safety

## 📚 What I Learned
- Some extensions may be **malicious** even if they look useful.
- Always verify the **developer**, **reviews**, and **permissions**.
- It’s good practice to review extensions regularly to maintain a secure browser environment.

## 📎 Notes
- If you are using a browser with extensions, make sure to check:
  - [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) – for Google Chrome
  - edge://extensions/ – for Microsoft Edge
  - about:addons – for Mozilla Firefox
