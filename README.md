Task 7 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

# 🛡️ Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
To learn how to review, identify, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions to ensure safe browsing and better performance.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Browser: Microsoft Edge

## 🔍 Task Summary
I accessed the extension settings in Microsoft Edge to review installed extensions. After inspection:
   - ✅ **No extensions were installed** in the browser.
   - 📸 Screenshot was taken as proof (if applicable).

## 📌 What to Check in Browser Extensions (Guidelines)
   If any extensions were present, I would review them based on the following:

### ⚠️ Risk Indicators:
- Unknown or suspicious extension names
- Low ratings or negative reviews
- Excessive permissions, such as:
  - “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit”
  - “Access your clipboard”
  - “Read your browsing history”

## 🗑️ Actions to Take for Suspicious Extensions
If any of the above risks were identified, the steps would be:
   1. Click “Remove” or “Disable” the extension.
   2. Restart the browser to apply changes.

## ✅ Benefits of Completing the Task
- Improved browser security and performance
- Reduced risk of data theft or malware
- Gained practical awareness of browser extension safety

## 📚 What I Learned
- Some extensions may be **malicious** even if they look useful.
- Always verify the **developer**, **reviews**, and **permissions**.
- It’s good practice to review extensions regularly to maintain a secure browser environment.

## 📎 Notes
- If you are using a browser with extensions, make sure to check:
  - [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) – for Google Chrome
  - edge://extensions/ – for Microsoft Edge
  - about:addons – for Mozilla Firefox
 
# Conclusion
   By following the above steps, the suspicious extension was removed, resulting in improved browser performance and enhanced security awareness.

# Interview Questions

# 1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?**
Browser extensions can:
* Access sensitive data: like passwords, browsing history, cookies, or credit card info.
* Inject malicious code: into websites you visit, modifying content or stealing data.
* Track your activity: sending your data to third parties without your consent.
* Act as malware : if developed with bad intent or hijacked after installation.

#2 . What permissions should raise suspicion? 
Be cautious of extensions that ask for:
   * “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit”– broad and powerful access.
   * Access to clipboard data – can capture copied passwords or sensitive information.
   * Access to downloads, file system, or device info – unnecessary for most extensions. 
   * Background access and full browser control – often not required.

# 3. How to safely install browser extensions?
   * ✅ **Use official stores**: like Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons.
   * ✅ **Check reviews and ratings**.
   * ✅ **Review developer info** and update history.
   * ✅ **Limit permissions** where possible.
   * ✅ **Avoid third-party websites** offering extensions.
   * ✅ **Read the privacy policy** of the extension.


# 4. What is extension sandboxing?
Extension sandboxing is a security feature that:
   * Isolates an extension from the core browser and other extensions.
   * Limits access to sensitive APIs or system resources.
   * Helps prevent one compromised extension from affecting the entire system.

# 5. Can extensions steal passwords?
Yes, malicious or compromised extensions can:
   * Log keystrokes (keyloggers).
   * Read autofill data from forms.
   * Access cookies storing session tokens.
   * Trick users into entering credentials into fake forms.
   * Always be wary of extensions with form-reading or page-editing capabilities.

# 6. How to update extensions securely?
   * 🔄Enable automatic updates in browser settings.
   * 🔍 regularly review extension permissions after updates.
   * 📦 Avoid sideloaded extensions (manually installed), as they don't auto-update.
   * ✅ Re-check extension reviews occasionally; sometimes, good extensions get sold and turn malicious.

# 7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
| Feature        | Extensions                     | Plugins                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Add features to the browser    | Add support for specific content |
| **Example**    | Ad blockers, password managers | Flash Player, Java Plugin        |
| **Technology** | HTML, JS, CSS                  | External software modules        |
| **Security**   | More sandboxed                 | Historically more vulnerable     |
| **Modern use** | Still in use                   | Mostly deprecated (e.g., Flash)  |


# 8. How to report malicious extensions?
*🔹Chrome Web Store:
   Go to the extension’s page → Click Report abuse
* Firefox Add-ons**:
  Visit the extension page → Click **"Report this add-on for abuse"**.
*🔹Also consider:
       * Submitting to Google Safe Browsing or Microsoft Edge security team**.
       * Reporting on platforms like **Reddit** or GitHubif  open source.
